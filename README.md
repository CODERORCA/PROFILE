- 👋 Hi, I’m Kevin a.k.a @Coderorca
- 👀 I’m interested in anything that is about Coding. I also like to read and research topics such as astronomy and nuclear physics in my leisure time.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning various programming languages, but mostly Python right now. Later planned to get better in Java.
- ✏ Did you know? I also love to make digital Art. Krita, Pro Create and Affinity Designer are one of my many tools in my arsenal.
