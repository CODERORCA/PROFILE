- 🧒 Hi, my name is Kevin a.k.a Coderorca 
- 🌟 I have huge interest and curiosity in Cybersecurity and using my leisure time to learn a bit more each day
- 🖥 Currently, Python is the main high-level language I am taking use of. Will move on to also learn low-level code language C.
- ❗️Did you know? I also love to make digital Art. Krita, Pro Create and Affinity Software are one of my many tools in my arsenal.
- 🖍 And another thing, I am already using the successor of Windows 11: Ubuntu Linux.
